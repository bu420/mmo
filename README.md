# mmo
MMORPG over Telnet written in C23.

## Connect
Use a Telnet client to connect to server. 
Windows' built-in Telnet client does not support some key features and will not work.
Instead use something like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/). 
```
> telnet 127.0.0.1
```

## Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bu420/mmo
cd mmo
make
```
